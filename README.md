comet-atjine 0.1
================

A child theme of the excellent Comet Wordpress theme built by Frost Press.

## Features ##

* adds support for Image, Status post formats.
* makes the header less ridiculous
* makes the menus legible
* adds support for a favicon.ico
* "The Event Listing" plugin's event types won't look ridiculous.
* adds an attractive frame images when the post format is "Image"
* automatically deletes "_transients" left in the database by the otherwise great Google Analytics Dashboard. This is only because I was too lazy to write a whole plugin for it, so I just shoved it in the theme.

## Installation ##

The original Comet, without which this will not work, is available here:

   http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/comet

Once Comet is installed, install this comet-atjine directory into the
wp-content/themes subdirectory of your Wordpress installation.

Once the files are installed, you should be able to active the theme 
through the Wordpress Admin pages.
